#### Pytorch

```
 (1) with torch.no_grad(): 一定要带括号
```

###### 2.RuntimeError: module must have its parameters and buffers on device cuda:0 (device_ids[0]) but found one of them on device: cpu

```
device = torch.device("cuda")
    print(torch.cuda.is_available())
    model.to(device)

    model = nn.DataParallel(model, device_ids=[0,1])
    model = model.module
    解决方案：添加model.module
```



#### Git

1.远程仓库和本地仓库不一致

```
<报错信息>To https://github.com/JiHaobo1999/note.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/JiHaobo1999/note.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

之所以出现这个原因，是因为我在线上生成、编辑了README.md文件，而本地代码文件中不包含它，所以线上线下就对不上了。
```

```
解决方案
git pull --rebase origin master
之后再push
```

#### Linux

###### 1.关闭X server on Ubtuntu

```
1.ERROR: You appear to be running an X server; please exit X before
installing. For further details, please see the section INSTALLING
THE NVIDIA DRIVER in the README available on the Linux driver
download page at www.nvidia.com

解决方案：sudo systemctl stop lightdm.service
```
