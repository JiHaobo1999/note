#### Pytorch

```
 (1) with torch.no_grad(): 一定要带括号
```

#### Git

1.远程仓库和本地仓库不一致

```
<报错信息>To https://github.com/JiHaobo1999/note.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/JiHaobo1999/note.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

之所以出现这个原因，是因为我在线上生成、编辑了README.md文件，而本地代码文件中不包含它，所以线上线下就对不上了。
```

```
解决方案
git pull --rebase origin master
之后再push
```
